The product_api file contains the API class which handles all the calls to the API. The class contains the following functions :

1. A function to check if the method called exists in the class.

2. A login function to allow access only to authenticated users. This function has basic login validation.

3. A function to retrieve information about all products in the database.
I have also used memcache by using the library php_memcache.dll

4. A function which returns the type of request made.

5. Added a function to delete a product by comparing its "product id" with the database.

6. Added a function to search a product by it's id and retrieve information about the product.
